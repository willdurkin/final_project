final_project
=============
This is my final project for a General Assembly front end web development course. 
We were given the task of making whatever website we wanted.

The idea behind my project, (which I titled FEWD, after the course name) is to create a website where people can
organize and share music they find on Youtube. Youtube has an incredible database of music, but it lacks critical features.
FEWD is designed to be an on-demand streaming service buitl on top of the Youtube API.

Users can submit a song via a form on FEWD (a bookmarklet that also allows you to do this is in the works). This adds the
song to their personal library and to the site database, which is organized by genre and browsable to all users in 
a social news style feed.

In its current state FEWD is lacking user profile, library, and submit functionality, but it can currently plan songs that
I have harcoded using the custom player I built.
